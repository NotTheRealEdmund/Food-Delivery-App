A BLoC stands as a middleman between a source of data in your app (e.g an API response) and widgets that need the data. 
It receives streams of events/data from the source, handles any required business logic and publishes streams of data changes 
to widgets that are interested in them.

A BLoC has two simple components: Sinks and Streams, both of which are provided by a StreamController. 
You add streams of event/data input into a Sink and listen to them as streams of data output through a Stream.

UI layer <--> BLoC layer <--> Data layer
UI passes events to BLoC, BLoC changes state of UI layer
BLoC sends Async Request to Data layer, Data layer sends Async Response to BLoC

Inside BLoC layer:
--> Sink --> Business Logic --> StreamController --> Stream -->
